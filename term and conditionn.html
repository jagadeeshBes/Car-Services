        <p class="big">Description Of Goods</p>
        <p>We will take all reasonable care to ensure that all details, descriptions and prices of products appearing on the Website are correct at the time when the relevant information was entered onto the system. We must emphasise it is in everyone’s interest to ensure that the correct items are being ordered and are suited to your particular requirements. Although we aim to keep the Website as up to date as possible, the information including product descriptions appearing on this Website at a particular time may not always reflect the position exactly at the moment you place an order. While we will use reasonable endeavours to verify the accuracy of any information we place on the Website, we make no warranties, whether express or implied in relation to its accuracy. Though we constantly strive to provide accurate and current information on this website, information contained in this site may contain technical inaccuracies or typographical errors.
